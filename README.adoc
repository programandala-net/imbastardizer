== Description

Imbastardizer is a BASIC preprocessor written in VimL.

== Goal

Easier cross-development in old dialects of BASIC.

== Planned target BASIC dialects

- GW-BASIC (DOS)
- MSX BASIC (MSX)
- Sinclair BASIC  (ZX Spectrum)
- SAM BASIC (SAM Coupé)
- MasterBASIC (SAM Coupé)
- Beta BASIC (ZX Spectrum)
- S*BASIC (QL)

== Ancestors

Imbastardizer is an improved replacement for previous tools that were
developed only for one specific dialect of BASIC:

- http://programandala.net/es.programa.bbim.html[BBim] for Beta BASIC
- http://programandala.net/en.program.mbim.html[MBim] for MasterBASIC
- http://programandala.net/es.programa.sbim.html[SBim] for S*BASIC
- http://programandala.net/en.program.vimclair_basic.html[Vimclair
  BASIC] for Sinclair BASIC

== Planned features

- Modular design
- The target BASIC dialect can be selected in the BASIC source
- The source converter is separated from the media maker
- Simple method to add new target BASIC dialects

== Status

The project was started in 2016-12.  It's under development, not
usable yet.
