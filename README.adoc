== Description

Imbastardizer is a BASIC preprocessor written in VimL.

== Goal

Easier cross-development in some dialects of BASIC that need line
numbers or lack control structures.

== Planned target BASIC dialects

- GW-BASIC (DOS)
- MSX BASIC (MSX)
- Sinclair BASIC (ZX Spectrum)
- SAM BASIC (SAM Coupé)
- MasterBASIC (SAM Coupé)
- S*BASIC (QL)
- Beta BASIC (ZX Spectrum)

== Features

* C-style block and line comments.
* Bash-style line comments.
* Splitted lines.
* Labels instead of line numbers.
* `#vim` directive to execute any Vim command in the source.
* Long variable names using the `#vim` directive to make the
  substitutions.
* Control structures (can be nested):
  ** `DO ... LOOP`
  ** `DO ... LOOP UNTIL`
  ** `DO ... LOOP WHILE`
  ** `DO UNTIL... LOOP`
  ** `DO UNTIL ... LOOP UNTIL`
  ** `DO UNTIL ... LOOP WHILE`
  ** `DO WHILE ... LOOP`
  ** `DO WHILE ... LOOP UNTIL`
  ** `DO WHILE ... LOOP WHILE`
  ** `EXIT DO`
  ** `EXIT FOR`
  ** `IF ... THEN ... ENDIF`
  ** `IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF`
  ** `IF ... THEN ... ELSE IF ... ELSE ... ENDIF` (with any number of
    `ELSE IF`)
* Procedures (without parameters):
  ** `DEF PROC`, `END PROC`, `EXIT PROC`, `CALL`.
* Procedures with parameters can be simulated ad hoc with the `#vim`
  directive.
* The `CALL` command can be changed with `#procedureCall`, e.g.:
  `#procedureCall proc` or even make it empty: `#procedureCall`.

== Ancestors

Imbastardizer is an improved replacement for previous tools that were
developed only for one specific dialect of BASIC:

- http://programandala.net/es.programa.bbim.html[BBim] for Beta BASIC
- http://programandala.net/en.program.mbim.html[MBim] for MasterBASIC
- http://programandala.net/es.programa.sbim.html[SBim] for S*BASIC
- http://programandala.net/en.program.vimclair_basic.html[Vimclair
  BASIC] for Sinclair BASIC

== Planned features

- Modular design.
- The target BASIC dialect can be selected in the BASIC source.
- The source converter is separated from the media maker.
- Simple method to add new target BASIC dialects.

== Status

The project was started in 2016-12.  It's under development, but already used
to develop a project in GW-BASIC with http://pc-basic.org[PC-BASIC].
